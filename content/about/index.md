This is my site! It's hosted on GitHub Pages, uses Cloudflare and a free .gay domain from Porkbun. Eventually it will also be used for my Discord bot and Enmity Plugins, but for now it's basically just a profile for me with links to all the platforms I'm on.

The source code for this site is available [here](https://github.com/FieryFlames/fieryflames.github.io).
